I'm a fullstack developer with a focus on backend engineering, Ruby on Rails, React and working with APIs. Prior to software development, I worked in the educational and environmental sectors teaching languages and ecology, managing international development projects, and conducting trainings on environmental, health and social issues. I made the switch to software development in order to grow personally, to have a larger impact through tech, and to further challenge myself professionally and creatively.

My experiences working on teams, passion for making a difference in the lives of others, and love of puzzling and problem solving are just a small part of what I have to offer. Always looking to learn and share with others, don't hesitate to reach out!
