Some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **[FoundMyFitness](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/)** is a website and community focused on the science of nutrition, aging, fitness, and cognitive and physical wellbeing. Along with podcasts / videos and detailed write-ups on health topics, FoundMyFitness can use info from services like 23andMe or Ancestry.com to generate a personalized report of nutritional and lifestyle insights, specific to your genotype.

2. **[Skedaddle](https://github.com/easachs/skedaddle)** is a Rails 7 travel itinerary application implementing Hotwire (Turbo / Stimulus), TailwindCSS, a Postgres database, and Google OAuth / Omniauth. It uses Devise to handle user authentication and View Components to organize its interface. Skedaddle consumes multiple API endpoints to create a custom itinerary with parks, restaurants, airports, hospitals, museums and more. It also includes Google Analytics tracking and uses the Google Places API to provide autocomplete search functionality.

3. **[Heat Check](https://github.com/HeatChecc/Heat-Check-BE)** is a full stack web application with a React frontend and Rails backend that aims to help food aficionados find spicy restaurants and dishes with ratings and reviews. This was a group project designed and implemented by six developers over three weeks for the Turing School of Software and Design. Using an agile workflow and working with a project manager, we found restaurants via Yelp's Business API and scraped menus with Nokogiri. That data was exposed to the React app with GraphQL and deployed using CircleCI.

4. **[Sweater Weather](https://github.com/easachs/sweater-weather)** is a weather-forecast / book-lookup / roadtrip-planning API with user registration where users can receive and use API keys to access search results. It hits several APIs including Mapquest and OpenWeather to process and respond to JSON requests from a front-end service.

5. **[Rails Engine](https://github.com/easachs/rails-engine)** is a Ruby on Rails / PostgreSQL database of merchants / items that exposes thirteen separate RESTful API endpoints. It includes search functionality, serialization, and full testing coverage. This was great practice, as it required building out purely back end API exposure, complex database queries, comprehensive error handling, and extensive testing.

6. **[Enigma Encoder](https://github.com/easachs/enigma)** is a multi-class secret message encryption / decryption application built with pure Ruby that uses an algorithm based on the Caesar Cipher.
